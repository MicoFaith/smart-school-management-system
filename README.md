# ðŸŽ“ Smart School Management System (Java OOP Project)

This is a simple **Smart School Management System** developed in **Java** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as **abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance**, and **polymorphism**. The goal of this project is to simulate the core structure of a school system with different roles such as students and teachers, and their interactions with courses.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Abstract base class `Person` with concrete subclasses:
    - `Student`
    - `Teacher`
- Abstract base class `Course` with concrete subclasses:
    - `MathCourse`
    - `ScienceCourse`
- Role display system using polymorphism
- Course details output
- Easily extendable to include:
    - Course enrollment
    - Grade tracking
    - Attendance
    - Admin dashboard

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8+)
- OOP Concepts (Abstract Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- CLI (Command-Line Interface)

## ðŸ§  Concepts Practiced

- Object-oriented design
- Code modularization
- Practical use of `abstract` classes
- Use of arrays to store objects
- Method overriding and dynamic dispatch

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
